fork: EOF
group: Subroutine and Function

*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

The **JUMPF** instruction jump to a code section without adding a new return stack frame, which is changing current section index without updating return stack. 

This allow us to chain function calls, while allow compiler to optimise code size and gas spent.

## Immediate argument

0. `target_section_index`: 16-bit unsigned value as metadata index in the type section of EOF container corresponds to a code section index

*TBD: Reproduce in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Operand stack size exceed global stack height limit.
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
