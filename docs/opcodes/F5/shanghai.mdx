## Gas

    minimum_word_size = (size + 31) / 32
    init_code_cost = {gasPrices|initCodeWordCost} * minimum_word_size
    hash_cost = {gasPrices|keccak256Word} * minimum_word_size
    code_deposit_cost = {gasPrices|createData} * deployed_code_size

    static_gas = {gasPrices|create}
    dynamic_gas = init_code_cost + hash_cost + memory_expansion_cost + deployment_code_execution_cost + code_deposit_cost

The `deployment_code_execution_cost` is the cost of whatever opcode is run to deploy the new contract.
On top of that, there are additional costs for storing the code of the new contract and performing a jumpdest-analysis, respectively shown as `code_deposit_cost` and `init_code_cost`.
The difference with [CREATE](#F0) is an additional cost to hash the initialisation code before.
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

The new contract address is added in the warm addresses. See section [access sets](/about).
