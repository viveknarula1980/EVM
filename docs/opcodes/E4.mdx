fork: EOF
group: Subroutine and Function

*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Context from [CALLF](/#E3), The **RETF** instruction return value from a function or subroutine, which pop an execution state from return stack and set to corresponding values (current section index, program counter).

## Example

*TBD: Reproduce in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
