## Gas

    static_gas = {gasPrices|extstaticcallGas}
    dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost + address_access_cost

The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

The different costs are:
 - `code_execution_cost` is the cost of the called code execution.
 - If `address` is not warm, then `address_access_cost` is {gasPrices|coldaccountaccess} minus {gasPrices|warmstorageread}, otherwise it is {gasPrices|warmstorageread}. See section [access sets](/about).
