_Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60)._

## Notes

Creates a new contract using the initialisation code provided at the indicated `offset` in the memory. Enters a new sub [context](/about) of the calculated destination address and executes the initialisation code, then resumes the current context.

Should deployment succeed, the new account's [code](/about) is set to the [return data](/about) resulting from executing the initialisation code.

The destination address is calculated as the rightmost 20 bytes (160 bits) of the Keccak-256 hash of the rlp encoding of the sender address followed by its nonce. That is:

    address = keccak256(rlp([sender_address,sender_nonce]))[12:]

Deployment can fail due to:
- A contract already exists at the destination address (can happen in combination with [CREATE2](/#F5) and [SELFDESTRUCT](/#FF)).
- Insufficient value to send.
- Sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD).
- Insufficient gas to execute the initialisation code.
- Call depth limit reached.

Note that these failures only affect the return value and do not cause the calling context to revert (unlike the error cases below).

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

## Stack input

0. `value`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the initialisation code for the new account.
2. `size`: byte size to copy (size of the initialisation code).

## Stack output

0. `address`: the address of the deployed contract, 0 if the deployment failed.

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:

- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) (since Byzantium fork) or an [EXTSTATICCALL](/#FB) (since EOF fork).
- `size` is greater than the chain's maximum initcode size (since Shanghai fork).
