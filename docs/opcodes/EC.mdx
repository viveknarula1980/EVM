*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Behavior on accessed_addresses and address collision is same as [CREATE2](/#F5).

The destination address is calculated as follows:

    initialisation_code = eof_container[initcontainer_index]
    address = keccak256(0xff + sender_address + salt + keccak256(initialisation_code))[12:]

Deployment can fail due to:
- A contract already exists at the destination address.
- Insufficient value to transfer.
- Sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD).
- Insufficient gas to execute the initialisation code.
- Call depth limit reached.

Note that these failures only affect the return value and do not cause the calling context to revert (unlike the error cases below).

## Immediate argument 

0. `initcontainer_index`: 8-bit unsigned value as the index of EOF subcontainer in the containers.

## Stack input

0. `value`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `salt`: 32-byte value used to create the new account at a deterministic address.
2. `input_offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the initialisation code of the new account.
3. `input_size`: byte size to copy (size of the initialisation code).

## Stack output

0. `address`: the address of the deployed EOF contract, 0 if the deployment failed.

## Examples

*TBD: See in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) (since Byzantium fork) or an [EXTSTATICCALL](/#FB) (since EOF fork).
- Deploy container code size exceed maximum code size, which is updated within [RETURNCONTRACT](/#EE).
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
