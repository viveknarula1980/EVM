fork: EOF 
group: Subroutine and Function

*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

A new return stack is introduced, it is a stack of items representing execution state to return to after function execution is finished.

The **CALLF** instruction call into a function or subroutine with given metadata index in the type section, then push an execution state onto the return stack. 

## Immediate argument

0. `target_section_index`: 16-bit unsigned value as metadata index in the type section of EOF container corresponds to a code section index

## Example

*TBD: Reproduce in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Return stack already has 1024 items.
- The called function exceed the global stack height limit.
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
