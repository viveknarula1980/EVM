## Gas

    minimum_word_size = (initcontainer_size + 31) / 32
    hash_cost = {gasPrices|keccak256WordGas} * minimum_word_size
    code_deposit_cost = {gasPrices|createDataGas} * deployed_code_size

    static_gas = {gasPrices|eofcreateGas}
    dynamic_gas = hash_cost + memory_expansion_cost + deployment_code_execution_cost + code_deposit_cost

The `deployment_code_execution_cost` is the cost of whatever opcode is run to deploy the new contract. 
On top of that, there are additional costs for storing the code of the new contract, respectively shown as `code_deposit_cost`.
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

The new contract address is added in the warm addresses. See section [access sets](/about).
