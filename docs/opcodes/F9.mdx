*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Creates a new sub [context](/about) as if calling itself, but with the [code](/about) of the given account. In particular the [storage](/about) remains the same. Note that an account with no code will return success status.

The size of the [return data](/about) can be retrieved after the call with the instructions [RETURNDATASIZE](/#3D) and [RETURNDATACOPY](/#3E) (since the Byzantium fork), or load 32-byte word onto the stack with [RETURNDATALOAD](/#F7) instruction.

All but one 64th (`remaining_gas / 64`) of the remaining gas of the current context is sent to the sub [context](/about) to execute, but no less than 2300. The gas that is not used by the sub context is returned to this one. In case gas not sent would be lower than 5000, the call fails returning 1 as `status`, but the current [context](/about) is not reverted.

If the call stack depth is 1024, the call fails returning 1 as `status`, but the current [context](/about) is not reverted.

## Stack input

0. `target_address`: the account which [context](/about) to execute.
1. `input_offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the [calldata](/about) of the sub [context](/about).
2. `input_size`: byte size to copy (size of the [calldata](/about)).

## Stack output

0. `status`: return 0 for success, 1 for revert if the sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD), 2 for failure.

## Examples

*TBD: See in playground.*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- The target address has more than 20 bytes.
- The target account code is legacy code (pre-EOF).
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
