*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Equivalent to [CREATE](/#F0), except the salt allows the new contract to be deployed at a consistent, deterministic address.

Should deployment succeed, the account's [code](/about) is set to the [return data](/about) resulting from executing the initialisation code.

The destination address is calculated as follows:

    initialisation_code = memory[offset:offset+size]
    address = keccak256(0xff + sender_address + salt + keccak256(initialisation_code))[12:]

Deployment can fail due to:
- A contract already exists at the destination address.
- Insufficient value to transfer.
- Sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD).
- Insufficient gas to execute the initialisation code.
- Call depth limit reached.

Note that these failures only affect the return value and do not cause the calling context to revert (unlike the error cases below).

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

## Stack input

0. `value`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the initialisation code of the new account.
2. `size`: byte size to copy (size of the initialisation code).
3. `salt`: 32-byte value used to create the new account at a deterministic address.

## Stack output

0. `address`: the address of the deployed contract, 0 if the deployment failed.

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) (since Byzantium fork) or an [EXTSTATICCALL](/#FB) (since EOF fork).
- `size` is greater than the chain's maximum initcode size (since Shanghai fork).
