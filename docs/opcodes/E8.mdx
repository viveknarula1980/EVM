*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Immediate argument

0. `imm`: 1 byte containing indices of stack items to swap. Given `n = imm >> 4 + 1`, `m = imm & 0x0F + 1`, `n + 1`th stack item is swapped with `n + m + 1`th. 

## Example

`E800` will swap the 2nd and 3rd stack item, `E8FF` will swap the 17th and 33rd stack item.

*TBD: Reproduce in playground*

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Execution in a legacy (non-EOF) context.
